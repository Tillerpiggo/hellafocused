# Recent Work Summary

## Task Move Sync Fix
**Issue**: Task moves worked locally but reverted after database sync
**Root Cause**: `updateTask` in sync engine wasn't updating `parent_id` and `project_id` fields
**Solution**: Modified `updateTask` to accept and use project/parent IDs from sync actions
**Files**: `lib/sync-engine.ts`, `store/app-store.ts`

## Task Hierarchy Move Validation Fix  
**Issue**: Couldn't move tasks up the hierarchy (e.g., from subtask to parent level)
**Root Cause**: `isTaskDescendantOf` parameters were swapped in validation check
**Solution**: Fixed parameter order in `moveTaskToNewParent` validation
**Files**: `lib/task-utils.ts`

## Move Dialog UI Improvements
**Added**: Quotes around destination names, text truncation for long names
**Files**: `components/task/move-task-dialog.tsx`

## Subtask Completion Celebration
**Feature**: Restored celebration screen when all subtasks of parent task are completed
**Implementation**: 
- Added `showSubtaskCelebration` state to focus store
- Detection logic in `completeFocusTask` checks if all parent's subtasks complete
- Shows `AllTasksCompletedView` in focus mode, dismissible with "Continue Journey"
**Files**: `store/focus-store.ts`, `components/focus/focus-view.tsx`

## Outstanding Issues
- Subtask celebration may not be showing (needs testing)
- Need to add cleanup: clear celebration state when exiting focus mode
